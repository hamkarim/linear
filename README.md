linear
======

Some linear algebra study materials. 

So far, we have here:

 - a set of study notes on linear algebra - you can build them from the latex source here, or find a recent build at kiparsky.net/files/linealg_1.pdf
 - a python implementation - still pretty rudimentary - of a matrix class
 - a set of practice exercises for matrix operations, implemented in octave
